On windows merge csv files using cmd:
1.Put all the files to be merged into 1 folder
2.open cmd and get into said file using "cd FolderPath"
3.type "copy *.csv FileName.csv"
4.This makes a file of files in the folder

Upload both win and place files to access 
1.Create database
2.External Data -> New Data Source -> From File -> Text File -> Filename.csv
3.Delimited -> Comma (click "First Row Contains Field Names") ->
4.Click on each not required row and select "Do not import field (Skip)"
5.I do No primary key for now
(ImportErrors are the row names from file merging - ignore)

Use SQL to merge the databases together
1.Createe Query Design
2.View - SQL here usually the code should be:

SELECT Allplaces.BSP, Allwins.BSP
FROM Allplaces
INNER JOIN Allwins 
ON (Allplaces.SELECTION_ID = Allwins.SELECTION_ID) 
AND (Allplaces.EVENT_ID = Allwins.EVENT_ID);

3.This creates a new table with Allplace.BSP and Allwins.BSP only where both eventID and selectionID match
But in these files there is no data which meets that criteria 
which is why I am a bit confused with what we are trying to get here

That means place and win documents are not about the same events?
